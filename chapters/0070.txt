I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the
combination.
Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
- I have no idea.
- Right now!
I said, right now! Right now!
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.
You'll have to do better than that.
All right. Bag them.  You're going for a ride.
We're worth more to you alive. You hear me?
What'd you get?
Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined.
This helps us how?
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.
