Robert we need to talk about a power of attorney.
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...
- Not now, Uncle Peter.
The vultures are circling.
The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so
forth.
So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning.
And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
Then, when we take him a level deeper his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.
So he gives himself the idea.
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.  It has to seem self-generated.
Eames, I am impressed.
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
Were you going under on your own?
No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.
