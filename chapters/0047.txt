But the moment's past.
And whatever I do, I can't change this moment.
As I'm about to call out to them they run away.
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home.
The real world.
What are you doing here?
My name is...
I know who you are.  What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand.
How could you understand?
Do you know what it is to be a lover?
To be half of a whole?
No.
I'll tell you a riddle.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that will take you far away.
