I'm the head of your security down here.
Get out on a different floor, keep moving.
Dump the wallet.  Security will be looking for that.
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
Security, huh?
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Subconscious security.
You're talking about dreams?
Are you talking about, um, extraction?
I am here to protect you.
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.
