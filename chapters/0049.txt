- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
All right.
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
And it doesn't have to be me but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
Get us another seat on the plane.
If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.
Complete the job en route I make one phone call from the plane you have no trouble getting through Immigration.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.
Excuse me, I think this is yours?  You must have dropped it.
Would you care for a drink?
