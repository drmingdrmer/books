We're gonna talk about this.
All right?
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.
Take a second, think about our children.
Think about James.
Think about Phillipa, now.
If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
How you've threatened to kill me.
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.
Why did...?  Why would you do this to me?
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
