Why is that so important?
In case one of us brings in our projections.
We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
You mean in case you bring Mal in.
You can't keep her out, can you?
- Right.
- You can't build because if you know the maze, then she knows it.
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
No one said it's getting worse.
I need to get home.  That's all I care about right now.
Why can't you go home?
Because they think I killed her.
- Thank you.
