- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?
No, to find Saito.
He'll be lost.
No, he'll be all right.
Have you come to kill me?
I'm waiting for someone.
Someone from a half-remembered dream.
Cobb?
Impossible.
We were young men together.
I'm an old man.
Filled with regret.
Waiting to die alone.
I've come back for you.
To remind you of something.
