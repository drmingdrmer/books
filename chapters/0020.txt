You've got the basic layout.  Bookstore, caf?

- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.
- Yours?
- Yes.
Remember, you are the dreamer.  You build this world.

The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?
Well...
