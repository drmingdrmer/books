You don't understand.  These are moments I regret.
They're memories that I have to change.
Well, what's down there that you regret?
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.
This is your house?
Mine and Mal's, yes.
Where is she?
She's already gone.
That's my son, James.
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.
That's Phillipa.
I thought about calling out to them so they'd turn and smile and I could see those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.
Right now or never, Cobb.
Then I start to panic.
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment that I need to see their faces one last time.
James! Phillipa! Come on in!
