- You're not real?
- No.
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.
I was sent here to protect you in the event that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you get me out of here?
Right away. Follow me.
Hold on a second.
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?
