Hey, Mr. Cobb.
How would you like to go home?
To America. To your children.
You can't fix that. No one can.
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.
No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.
If I were to do this, if I even could do it I'd need a guarantee.
- How do I know you can deliver?
