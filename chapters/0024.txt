That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?
Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.
Something you can have on you that no one else knows.
- Like a coin?
- No.
It needs to be more unique than that.  Like, this is a loaded die.
No, I can't let you touch it.  That would defeat the purpose.
See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.
That way, when you look at your totem you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
