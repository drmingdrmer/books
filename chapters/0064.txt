I wanted to go deeper and deeper.  I wanted to go further.
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down
there that we could get trapped so deep that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious we lost sight of what was real.
We created.  We built the world for ourselves.
We did that for years.
We built our own world.
How long were you stuck there?
Something like 50 years.
Jesus.
How could you stand it?
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.
The problem was knowing that none of it was real.
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.
And what about for her?
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
