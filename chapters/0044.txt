One of the longest flights in the world.  He makes it every two weeks.
He must be flying private, then.
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?
On a 747, the pilot's up top the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
I bought the airline.
It seemed neater.
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Of course I do.
You said you had a dream.
