<p>All right. Taxi. Thank you.</p>

<p>- What are you doing?</p>
<p>- Sorry, I thought it was free.</p>
<p>- It's not.</p>
<p>- Maybe we could share.</p>
<p>Maybe not.  Can you pull over and get this...?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>There's $500 in there.  The wallet's worth more than that.</p>
<p>You might at least drop me at my stop.</p>
