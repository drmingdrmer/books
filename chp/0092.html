Look, you get him in there.</p>
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital and we all ride the kick back up the layers.</p>
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges.</p>
Saito will never make it, will he?</p>
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.</p>
- Go for it.</p>
If you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you.</p>
She's right. She's right.  Come on. Let's go.</p>
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?</p>
Mal's gonna be down there.</p>
I know where to find her.  She'll have Fischer.</p>
- How do you know?</p>
- Because she wants me to come after him.</p>
She wants me back down there with her.</p>
All right?</p>
- This is your world?
