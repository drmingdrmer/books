Look, you get him in there.
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges.
Saito will never make it, will he?
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.
If you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you.
She's right. She's right.  Come on. Let's go.
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
Mal's gonna be down there.
I know where to find her.  She'll have Fischer.
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.
She wants me back down there with her.
All right?
- This is your world?
