Dad?
That's the kick, Ariadne!  You have to go now!
Don't lose yourself!  Find Saito and bring him back!
I will!
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Yes.
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
But we did.
We did. You don't remember?
I miss you more than I can bear but we had our time together.
And I have to let you go.
I have to let you go.
I'm sorry, Robert.
You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man not just to live for him.
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.
What happened?
