Dad?</p>
That's the kick, Ariadne!  You have to go now!</p>
Don't lose yourself!  Find Saito and bring him back!</p>
I will!</p>
You remember when you asked me to marry you?</p>
Yes.</p>
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.</p>
But we did.</p>
We did. You don't remember?</p>
I miss you more than I can bear but we had our time together.</p>
And I have to let you go.</p>
I have to let you go.</p>
I'm sorry, Robert.</p>
You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man not just to live for him.</p>
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.</p>
