- Sweetheart, what are you doing?</p>
- Join me.</p>

If you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember? You're gonna die.</p>
Now, just step back inside.</p>
Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.</p>
We've talked enough.</p>

- Come out onto the ledge or I'll jump right now.</p>
- Okay.
