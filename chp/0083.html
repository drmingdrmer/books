<p>A challenge for you to build something for yourself by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.</p>
<p>- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?</p>
<p>- I'm sorry.</p>
<p>But he's wrong.</p>
<p>You can build a better company than he ever did.</p>
<p>Mr. Fischer? He's lying.</p>
<p>- How do you know?</p>
<p>- Trust me, it's what I do.</p>
<p>He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.</p>
<p>I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.</p>
<p>We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>- He's out.</p>
<p>- Wait.</p>
<p>Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?</p>
<p>We're going into Fischer's.</p>
