A challenge for you to build something for yourself by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.
But he's wrong.
You can build a better company than he ever did.
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.
He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
All right.
- He's out.
- Wait.
Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
We're going into Fischer's.
