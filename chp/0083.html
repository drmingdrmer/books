A challenge for you to build something for yourself by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.</p>
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?</p>
- I'm sorry.</p>
But he's wrong.</p>
You can build a better company than he ever did.</p>
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.</p>
- How do you know?</p>
- Trust me, it's what I do.</p>
He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.</p>
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.</p>
We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.</p>
All right.</p>
- He's out.</p>
- Wait.</p>
Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?</p>
We're going into Fischer's.
