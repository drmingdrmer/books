We're gonna talk about this.</p>
All right?</p>
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.</p>
- No, honey.</p>
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.</p>
Take a second, think about our children.</p>
Think about James.</p>
Think about Phillipa, now.</p>
If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.</p>
- What does that mean?</p>
- I filed a letter with our attorney explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.</p>
How you've threatened to kill me.</p>
- Why did you do this?</p>
- I love you, Dom.</p>
Why did...?  Why would you do this to me?</p>
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
