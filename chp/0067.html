<p>We're gonna talk about this.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.</p>
<p>- No, honey.</p>
<p>No, I can't. You know I can't do that.</p>
<p>Take a second, think about our children.</p>
<p>Think about James.</p>
<p>Think about Phillipa, now.</p>
<p>If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.</p>
<p>- What does that mean?</p>
<p>- I filed a letter with our attorney explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.</p>
<p>How you've threatened to kill me.</p>
<p>- Why did you do this?</p>
<p>- I love you, Dom.</p>
<p>Why did...?  Why would you do this to me?</p>
<p>I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.</p>
