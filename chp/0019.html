You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
If it's just a dream, then why are you...?
It's never just a dream, is it?
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.  When you're in it, it feels real.
That's why the military developed dream sharing.
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each
other and then wake up.
How did architects become involved?
Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?
Why don't you give us another five minutes?
Five minutes?
What...? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.
In a dream, your mind functions more quickly therefore time seems to feel more slow.
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
