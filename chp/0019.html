<p>You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.</p>
<p>This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.</p>
<p>If it's just a dream, then why are you...?</p>
<p>It's never just a dream, is it?</p>
<p>And a face full of glass hurts like hell.  When you're in it, it feels real.</p>
<p>That's why the military developed dream sharing.</p>
<p>It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each</p>
<p>other and then wake up.</p>
<p>How did architects become involved?</p>
<p>Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?</p>
<p>Why don't you give us another five minutes?</p>
<p>Five minutes?</p>
<p>What...? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.</p>
<p>In a dream, your mind functions more quickly therefore time seems to feel more slow.</p>
<p>Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.</p>
<p>Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?</p>
