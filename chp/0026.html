Thank you very much.</p>
Inception.</p>
Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me...</p>

Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.</p>
Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?</p>
He is good at what he does, right?</p>
Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination.</p>
Not like you.</p>
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination.</p>
Let me ask you something.  Have you done it before?</p>
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take.</p>

- No, it's not just about depth.
