<p>Strange weather, isn't it?</p>
<p>You feel that?</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.</p>
<p>For me. Quick, give me a kiss.</p>
<p>- They're still looking at us.</p>
<p>- Yeah, it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>We should probably get out of here.</p>
<p>You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity.</p>
<p>None of this is real. You're in a dream.</p>
<p>Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I...</p>
<p>No, breathe, breathe.  Remember your training.</p>
<p>Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
