Strange weather, isn't it?</p>
You feel that?</p>
What's happening?</p>
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.</p>
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.</p>
- They're still looking at us.</p>
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.</p>
We should probably get out of here.</p>
You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.</p>
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity.</p>
None of this is real. You're in a dream.</p>
Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?</p>
Yeah, I...</p>
No, breathe, breathe.  Remember your training.</p>
Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on.</p>
Mm-hm.
