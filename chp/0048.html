You know where you hope this train will take you but you don't know for sure.</p>
But it doesn't matter.</p>
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?</p>
Because you'll be together.</p>
- How could you bring her here?</p>
- What is this place?</p>
This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.</p>
What happened here?</p>
You promised!  You promised we'd be together!</p>
Please, I need you to stay here just for now!</p>
You said we'd be together!  You said we'd grow old together!</p>
I'll come back for you. I promise.</p>
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?</p>
Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?</p>
It's time.</p>
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
