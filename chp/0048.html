<p>You know where you hope this train will take you but you don't know for sure.</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?</p>
<p>Because you'll be together.</p>
<p>- How could you bring her here?</p>
<p>- What is this place?</p>
<p>This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.</p>
<p>What happened here?</p>
<p>You promised!  You promised we'd be together!</p>
<p>Please, I need you to stay here just for now!</p>
<p>You said we'd be together!  You said we'd grow old together!</p>
<p>I'll come back for you. I promise.</p>
<p>Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?</p>
<p>Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?</p>
<p>It's time.</p>
<p>Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.</p>
