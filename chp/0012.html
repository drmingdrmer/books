Hey, Mr. Cobb.</p>
How would you like to go home?</p>
To America. To your children.</p>
You can't fix that. No one can.</p>
- Just like inception.</p>
- Cobb, come on.</p>
- How complex is the idea?</p>
- Simple enough.</p>
No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.</p>
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.</p>
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.</p>
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.</p>
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.</p>
- Hold on.</p>
If I were to do this, if I even could do it I'd need a guarantee.</p>
- How do I know you can deliver?
