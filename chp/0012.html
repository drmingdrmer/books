<p>Hey, Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p>How would you like to go home?</p>
<p>To America. To your children.</p>
<p>You can't fix that. No one can.</p>
<p>- Just like inception.</p>
<p>- Cobb, come on.</p>
<p>- How complex is the idea?</p>
<p>- Simple enough.</p>
<p>No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.</p>
<p>My main competitor is an old man in poor health.</p>
<p>His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.</p>
<p>I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.</p>
<p>- Cobb, we should walk away from this.</p>
<p>- Hold on.</p>
<p>If I were to do this, if I even could do it I'd need a guarantee.</p>
<p>- How do I know you can deliver?</p>
