Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.</p>
I appreciate that, Saito.</p>
But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.</p>
Limbo is gonna become your reality.</p>
You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.</p>
Filled with regret?</p>
Waiting to die alone.</p>
No.</p>
I'll come back.</p>
And we'll be young men together again.</p>
Breathe.</p>
These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.</p>
- They just wanna ransom us.</p>
- I heard them.</p>
They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river.</p>
All right. What is in the safe?
