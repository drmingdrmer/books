<p>Is Mommy with you?</p>
<p>James, we talked about this.</p>
<p>Mommy's not here anymore.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.</p>
<p>Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?</p>
<p>And you be good, you be...</p>
<p>- Our ride's on the roof.</p>
<p>- Right.</p>
<p>Hey, are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?</p>
<p>Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up.</p>
<p>Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.  Won't happen again.</p>
<p>- It's getting worse, isn't it?</p>
<p>- One apology's all you're getting.</p>
<p>- Where's Nash?</p>
