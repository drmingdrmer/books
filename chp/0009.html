Is Mommy with you?</p>
James, we talked about this.</p>
Mommy's not here anymore.</p>
Where?</p>
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.</p>
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?</p>
And you be good, you be...</p>
- Our ride's on the roof.</p>
- Right.</p>
Hey, are you okay?</p>
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?</p>
Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up.</p>
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.  Won't happen again.</p>
- It's getting worse, isn't it?</p>
- One apology's all you're getting.</p>
- Where's Nash?
