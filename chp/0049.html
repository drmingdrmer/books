<p>- When's the funeral?</p>
<p>- Thursday. In Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>- Cobb, I'm coming with you.</p>
<p>- I promised Miles. No.</p>
<p>The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.</p>
<p>And it doesn't have to be me but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.</p>
<p>Get us another seat on the plane.</p>
<p>If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Complete the job en route I make one phone call from the plane you have no trouble getting through Immigration.</p>
<p>- I'm sorry.</p>
<p>- Oh, yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Excuse me, I think this is yours?  You must have dropped it.</p>
<p>Would you care for a drink?</p>
