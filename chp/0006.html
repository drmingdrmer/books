<p>We won't last two days.</p>
<p>Cobb?</p>
<p>Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.</p>
<p>Tell us what you know!  Tell us what you know, now!</p>
<p>I've always hated this carpet.</p>
<p>It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.</p>
<p>But very definitely made of wool.</p>
<p>Right now I'm lying on polyester.</p>
<p>Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment.</p>
<p>You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p>I'm still dreaming.</p>
<p>- How'd it go?</p>
<p>- Not good.</p>
<p>Dream within a dream, huh?  I'm impressed.</p>
<p>But in my dream, you play by my rules.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...</p>
