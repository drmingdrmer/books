Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor.
How can you do that?
Because I am the most skilled extractor.
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep your defense is never down.
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife better than your therapist, better than anyone.
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets I need to know what's in that safe.
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal.
He knows.
What's going on up there?
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.  Trust me.
The information is in the safe.
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
