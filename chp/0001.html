Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor.</p>
How can you do that?</p>
Because I am the most skilled extractor.</p>
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.</p>
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep your defense is never down.</p>
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.</p>
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife better than your therapist, better than anyone.</p>
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets I need to know what's in that safe.</p>
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.</p>
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal.</p>
He knows.</p>
What's going on up there?</p>
Saito knows. He's playing with us.</p>
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.  Trust me.</p>
The information is in the safe.</p>
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
