<p>You've got the basic layout.  Bookstore, caf?</p>
<p>Almost everything else is here too.</p>
<p>- Who are the people?</p>
<p>- Projections of my subconscious.</p>
<p>- Yours?</p>
<p>- Yes.</p>
<p>Remember, you are the dreamer.  You build this world.</p>
<p>I am the subject. My mind populates it.</p>
<p>You can literally talk to my subconscious.</p>
<p>That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.</p>
<p>How else do you do it?</p>
<p>By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail.</p>
<p>The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.</p>
<p>- You understand?</p>
<p>- Then you break in and steal it?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
