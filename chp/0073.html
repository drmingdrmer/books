<p>There goes Mr. Charles.</p>
<p>Mr. Fischer, right?</p>
<p>Pleasure to see you again.  Rod Green from marketing. L...</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>- And you must be?</p>
<p>- Leaving.</p>
<p>In case you get bored.</p>
<p>Must've blown you off.</p>
<p>That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits.</p>
<p>Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.</p>
<p>Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500...</p>
<p>About $500, right?</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.  My people are already on it as we speak.</p>
<p>Who or what is Mr. Charles?</p>
<p>It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.</p>
<p>And why don't you approve?</p>
