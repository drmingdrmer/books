And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.</p>
It can grow to define or destroy you.</p>
The smallest idea, such as:</p>
"Your world is not real."</p>
Simple little thought that changes everything.</p>
So certain of your world. Of what's real.</p>
Do you think he is?</p>
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?</p>
I know what's real, Mal.</p>
No creeping doubts?</p>
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?</p>
Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces the way the projections persecute the dreamer?</p>
Admit it.</p>
You don't believe in one reality anymore.</p>
So choose.</p>
Choose to be here.
