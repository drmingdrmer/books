<p>And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.</p>
<p>It can grow to define or destroy you.</p>
<p>The smallest idea, such as:</p>
<p>"Your world is not real."</p>
<p>Simple little thought that changes everything.</p>
<p>So certain of your world. Of what's real.</p>
<p>Do you think he is?</p>
<p>Or do you think he's as lost as I was?</p>
<p>I know what's real, Mal.</p>
<p>No creeping doubts?</p>
<p>Not feeling persecuted, Dom?</p>
<p>Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces the way the projections persecute the dreamer?</p>
<p>Admit it.</p>
<p>You don't believe in one reality anymore.</p>
<p>So choose.</p>
<p>Choose to be here.</p>
