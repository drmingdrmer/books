And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
It can grow to define or destroy you.
The smallest idea, such as:
"Your world is not real."
Simple little thought that changes everything.
So certain of your world. Of what's real.
Do you think he is?
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
I know what's real, Mal.
No creeping doubts?
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?
Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
Admit it.
You don't believe in one reality anymore.
So choose.
Choose to be here.
