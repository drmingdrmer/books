I wanted to go deeper and deeper.  I wanted to go further.</p>
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down</p>
there that we could get trapped so deep that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious we lost sight of what was real.</p>
We created.  We built the world for ourselves.</p>
We did that for years.</p>
We built our own world.</p>
How long were you stuck there?</p>
Something like 50 years.</p>
Jesus.</p>
How could you stand it?</p>
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.</p>
The problem was knowing that none of it was real.</p>
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.</p>
And what about for her?</p>
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.</p>
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
