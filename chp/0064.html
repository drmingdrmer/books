<p>I wanted to go deeper and deeper.  I wanted to go further.</p>
<p>I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down</p>
<p>there that we could get trapped so deep that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious we lost sight of what was real.</p>
<p>We created.  We built the world for ourselves.</p>
<p>We did that for years.</p>
<p>We built our own world.</p>
<p>How long were you stuck there?</p>
<p>Something like 50 years.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>How could you stand it?</p>
<p>It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.</p>
<p>The problem was knowing that none of it was real.</p>
<p>Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.</p>
<p>And what about for her?</p>
<p>She had locked something away, something deep inside her.</p>
<p>A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.</p>
