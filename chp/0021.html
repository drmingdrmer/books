I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
It's something, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Why are they all looking at me?
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on
you.
Converge?
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.
Just you.
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this...
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
