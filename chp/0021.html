<p>I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.</p>
<p>My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?</p>
<p>It's something, isn't it?</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Why are they all looking at me?</p>
<p>Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.</p>
<p>The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>Converge?</p>
<p>They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.</p>
<p>They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.</p>
<p>- What, they're gonna attack us?</p>
<p>- No, no.</p>
<p>Just you.</p>
<p>This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this...</p>
<p>Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?</p>
