I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.</p>
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?</p>
It's something, isn't it?</p>
Yes, it is.</p>
Why are they all looking at me?</p>
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.</p>
The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on</p>
you.</p>
Converge?</p>
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.</p>
They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.</p>
- What, they're gonna attack us?</p>
- No, no.</p>
Just you.</p>
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this...</p>
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
