You don't understand.  These are moments I regret.</p>
They're memories that I have to change.</p>
Well, what's down there that you regret?</p>
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.</p>
This is your house?</p>
Mine and Mal's, yes.</p>
Where is she?</p>
She's already gone.</p>
That's my son, James.</p>
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.</p>
That's Phillipa.</p>
I thought about calling out to them so they'd turn and smile and I could see those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.</p>
Right now or never, Cobb.</p>
Then I start to panic.</p>
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment that I need to see their faces one last time.</p>
James! Phillipa! Come on in!
