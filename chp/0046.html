<p>You don't understand.  These are moments I regret.</p>
<p>They're memories that I have to change.</p>
<p>Well, what's down there that you regret?</p>
<p>Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.</p>
<p>This is your house?</p>
<p>Mine and Mal's, yes.</p>
<p>Where is she?</p>
<p>She's already gone.</p>
<p>That's my son, James.</p>
<p>He's digging for something, maybe a worm.</p>
<p>That's Phillipa.</p>
<p>I thought about calling out to them so they'd turn and smile and I could see those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.</p>
<p>Right now or never, Cobb.</p>
<p>Then I start to panic.</p>
<p>I realize I'm gonna regret this moment that I need to see their faces one last time.</p>
<p>James! Phillipa! Come on in!</p>
