<p>- The kick.</p>
<p>Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?</p>
<p>Yeah, we missed it.</p>
<p>Man.</p>
<p>Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?</p>
<p>Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Well, what the hell do we do now?</p>
<p>We finish the job before the next kick.</p>
<p>- What next kick?</p>
<p>- When the van hits the water.</p>
<p>If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.</p>
<p>If you need help, hang up...</p>
<p>How do I drop you without gravity?</p>
<p>Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.</p>
<p>You okay?</p>
<p>Run! Turn around!  Move to base! Move to base!</p>
