- The kick.</p>
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?</p>
Yeah, we missed it.</p>
Man.</p>
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?</p>
Uh-huh.</p>

We finish the job before the next kick.</p>
- What next kick?</p>
- When the van hits the water.</p>
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.</p>
If you need help, hang up...</p>
How do I drop you without gravity?</p>
Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.</p>
You okay?</p>
Run! Turn around!  Move to base! Move to base!
