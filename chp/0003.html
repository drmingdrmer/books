Just getting some fresh air.</p>
Stay where you are, Mal.</p>
Goddamn it.</p>
Turn around.</p>
The gun, Dom.</p>

Did she tell you?  Or have you known all along?</p>
That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?</p>
I want to know the name of your employer.</p>
Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?</p>
That depends on what you're threatening.</p>
Killing him would just wake him up.</p>
But pain...</p>
Pain is in the mind.</p>
And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
