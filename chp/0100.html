- Cobb, you can't do this.</p>
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.</p>
He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!</p>
- Take Fischer with you, all right?</p>
- You can't stay here to be with her.</p>
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.</p>
That means he's down here somewhere.  That means I have to find him.</p>
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.</p>
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.</p>
No.</p>
I wish.</p>
I wish more than anything, but I can't imagine you with all your complexity all your perfection, all your imperfection.</p>
- You all right?</p>
- Yeah.</p>
Look at you.</p>
You're just a shade.  You're just a shade of my real wife.
