- Cobb, you can't do this.
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.
He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!
- Take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
That means he's down here somewhere.  That means I have to find him.
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
No.
I wish.
I wish more than anything, but I can't imagine you with all your complexity all your perfection, all your imperfection.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Look at you.
You're just a shade.  You're just a shade of my real wife.
