<p>- Cobb, you can't do this.</p>
<p>Go check he's alive right now. Do it.</p>
<p>He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!</p>
<p>- Take Fischer with you, all right?</p>
<p>- You can't stay here to be with her.</p>
<p>I'm not. Saito's dead by now.</p>
<p>That means he's down here somewhere.  That means I have to find him.</p>
<p>I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.</p>
<p>I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>I wish more than anything, but I can't imagine you with all your complexity all your perfection, all your imperfection.</p>
<p>- You all right?</p>
<p>- Yeah.</p>
<p>Look at you.</p>
<p>You're just a shade.  You're just a shade of my real wife.</p>
