I couldn't shoot her.
There's no use in reviving him.  His mind's already trapped down there.
It's all over.
So that's it, then? We failed?
We're done. I'm sorry.
It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
Let's set the charges.
No, there's still another way.
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.
No, but there will be enough time down there.
And we will find him.
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive
him.
We can give him his own kick down below.
