I couldn't shoot her.</p>
There's no use in reviving him.  His mind's already trapped down there.</p>
It's all over.</p>
So that's it, then? We failed?</p>
We're done. I'm sorry.</p>
It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?</p>
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.</p>
Let's set the charges.</p>

- We have to follow Fischer down there.</p>
- Not enough time.</p>
No, but there will be enough time down there.</p>
And we will find him.</p>
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive</p>
him.</p>
We can give him his own kick down below.
