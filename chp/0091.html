<p>It's all over.</p>
<p>So that's it, then? We failed?</p>
<p>We're done. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?</p>
<p>Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.</p>
<p>Let's set the charges.</p>
<p>No, there's still another way.</p>
<p>- We have to follow Fischer down there.</p>
<p>- Not enough time.</p>
<p>No, but there will be enough time down there.</p>
<p>And we will find him.</p>
<p>Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>We can give him his own kick down below.</p>
