Limbo became her reality.
What happened when you woke up?
Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
I knew something was wrong with her.  She just wouldn't admit it.
Eventually, she told me the truth.
She was possessed by an idea.
This one very simple idea that changed everything.
That our world wasn't real.
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home we had to kill ourselves.
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.
I can tell the difference.
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?
You don't know you're dreaming!
