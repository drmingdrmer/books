Limbo became her reality.</p>
What happened when you woke up?</p>
Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?</p>
I knew something was wrong with her.  She just wouldn't admit it.</p>
Eventually, she told me the truth.</p>
She was possessed by an idea.</p>
This one very simple idea that changed everything.</p>
That our world wasn't real.</p>
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home we had to kill ourselves.</p>
- What about your children?</p>
- She thought they were projections that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.</p>
- I'm their mother!</p>
- Calm down.</p>
I can tell the difference.</p>
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?</p>
You don't know you're dreaming!
