<p>Limbo became her reality.</p>
<p>What happened when you woke up?</p>
<p>Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?</p>
<p>I knew something was wrong with her.  She just wouldn't admit it.</p>
<p>Eventually, she told me the truth.</p>
<p>She was possessed by an idea.</p>
<p>This one very simple idea that changed everything.</p>
<p>That our world wasn't real.</p>
<p>That she needed to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home we had to kill ourselves.</p>
<p>- What about your children?</p>
<p>- She thought they were projections that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.</p>
<p>- I'm their mother!</p>
<p>- Calm down.</p>
<p>I can tell the difference.</p>
<p>If this is my dream, why can't I control this?</p>
<p>You don't know you're dreaming!</p>
