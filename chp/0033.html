<p>- What for?</p>
<p>- Here, I'll show you.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will not want to see.</p>
<p>After you.</p>
<p>Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.</p>
<p>They come every day to share the dream.</p>
<p>You see? Very stable.</p>
<p>- How long do they dream for?</p>
<p>- Three, four hours, each day.</p>
<p>In dream time?</p>
<p>With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.</p>
<p>- Why do they do it?</p>
<p>- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p>After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.</p>
<p>Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?</p>
<p>- They come here every day to sleep?</p>
