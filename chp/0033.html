- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.
Perhaps you will not want to see.
After you.
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
They come every day to share the dream.
You see? Very stable.
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.
In dream time?
With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
- They come here every day to sleep?
