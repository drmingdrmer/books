- What for?</p>
- Here, I'll show you.</p>
Perhaps you will not want to see.</p>
After you.</p>
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.</p>
They come every day to share the dream.</p>
You see? Very stable.</p>
- How long do they dream for?</p>
- Three, four hours, each day.</p>
In dream time?</p>
With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.</p>
- Why do they do it?</p>
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.</p>
After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.</p>
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?</p>
- They come here every day to sleep?
