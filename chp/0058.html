We have it on good authority you do know.
Yeah? Whose authority?
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?
Cash, cards, ID. And this.
Useful?
Maybe.
You're on. You've got an hour.
An hour?
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please.
- What's that?
- Good authority.
Uncle Peter.
Just make them stop.
