We have it on good authority you do know.</p>
Yeah? Whose authority?</p>
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.</p>
- What's inside it?</p>
Cash, cards, ID. And this.</p>
Useful?</p>
Maybe.</p>
You're on. You've got an hour.</p>
An hour?</p>
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.</p>
And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.</p>
You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please.</p>
- What's that?</p>
- Good authority.</p>
Uncle Peter.</p>
Just make them stop.
