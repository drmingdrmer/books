- Hi, Dad.</p>
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?  How you doing, huh?</p>
- Good.</p>
- Okay, I guess.</p>
Okay? Who's just okay?  Is that you, James?</p>
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?</p>
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.  Not for a while, remember?</p>
Why?</p>
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?</p>
Grandma says you're never coming back.</p>
Phillipa, is that you?</p>
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?</p>
She's shaking her head.</p>
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.</p>
Daddy?</p>
Yeah, James?
