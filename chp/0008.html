- Hi, Dad.
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?  How you doing, huh?
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.
Okay? Who's just okay?  Is that you, James?
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.  Not for a while, remember?
Why?
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?
Grandma says you're never coming back.
Phillipa, is that you?
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?
She's shaking her head.
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.
Daddy?
Yeah, James?
