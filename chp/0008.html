<p>- Hi, Dad.</p>
<p>Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?  How you doing, huh?</p>
<p>- Good.</p>
<p>- Okay, I guess.</p>
<p>Okay? Who's just okay?  Is that you, James?</p>
<p>Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?</p>
<p>Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.  Not for a while, remember?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?</p>
<p>Grandma says you're never coming back.</p>
<p>Phillipa, is that you?</p>
<p>Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?</p>
<p>She's shaking her head.</p>
<p>Well, just hope she's wrong about that.</p>
<p>Daddy?</p>
<p>Yeah, James?</p>
