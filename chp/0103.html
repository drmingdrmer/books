- Cobb stayed.</p>
- With Mal?</p>
No, to find Saito.</p>
He'll be lost.</p>
No, he'll be all right.</p>
Have you come to kill me?</p>
I'm waiting for someone.</p>
Someone from a half-remembered dream.</p>
Cobb?</p>
Impossible.</p>
We were young men together.</p>
I'm an old man.</p>
Filled with regret.</p>
Waiting to die alone.</p>
I've come back for you.</p>
To remind you of something.
