- No, I have to judge it for myself.
While you're all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be

So we get a nice synchronized kick.
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.
But if it's too late, I won't be able to drop us.
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.
- Can't drop you without gravity.
