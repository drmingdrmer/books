<p>Five, two... It was something, it was a long number.</p>
<p>That's good. We can start there.  Fifth floor.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>- So do you use a timer?</p>
<p>- No, I have to judge it for myself.</p>
<p>While you're all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.</p>
<p>- Well, how will you know?</p>
<p>- His music warns me.</p>
<p>And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be</p>
<p>unmistakable.</p>
<p>So we get a nice synchronized kick.</p>
<p>If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.</p>
<p>But if it's too late, I won't be able to drop us.</p>
<p>- Well, why not?</p>
<p>- Because the van will be in freefall.</p>
<p>- Can't drop you without gravity.</p>
