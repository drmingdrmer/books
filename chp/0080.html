Five, two... It was something, it was a long number.</p>
That's good. We can start there.  Fifth floor.</p>
Yep.</p>
- So do you use a timer?</p>
- No, I have to judge it for myself.</p>
While you're all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.</p>
- Well, how will you know?</p>
- His music warns me.</p>
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be</p>
unmistakable.</p>
So we get a nice synchronized kick.</p>
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.</p>
But if it's too late, I won't be able to drop us.</p>
- Well, why not?</p>
- Because the van will be in freefall.</p>
- Can't drop you without gravity.
