I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
Pleased to meet you.
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with
you.
A work placement?
Not exactly.
I have a test for you.
You're not gonna tell me anything first?
Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it.
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
Stop.
Again.
Stop.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
