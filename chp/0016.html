I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.</p>
Pleased to meet you.</p>
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with</p>
you.</p>
A work placement?</p>
Not exactly.</p>
I have a test for you.</p>
You're not gonna tell me anything first?</p>
Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it.</p>
- Why?</p>
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.</p>
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.</p>
Stop.</p>
Again.</p>
Stop.</p>
You're gonna have to do better than that.
