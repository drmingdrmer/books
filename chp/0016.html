<p>I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.</p>
<p>Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p>If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>A work placement?</p>
<p>Not exactly.</p>
<p>I have a test for you.</p>
<p>You're not gonna tell me anything first?</p>
<p>Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it.</p>
<p>- Why?</p>
<p>- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.</p>
<p>You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>You're gonna have to do better than that.</p>
