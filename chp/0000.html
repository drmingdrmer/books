<p>I've seen one before.  Many, many years ago.</p>
<p>It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.</p>
<p>A man possessed of some radical notions.</p>
<p>What is the most resilient parasite?</p>
<p>A bacteria? A virus?</p>
<p>An intestinal worm?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...</p>
<p>An idea.</p>
<p>Resilient. Highly contagious.</p>
<p>Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.</p>
<p>An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks.</p>
<p>Right in there somewhere.</p>
<p>For someone like you to steal?</p>
<p>Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.</p>
<p>It's called extraction.</p>
