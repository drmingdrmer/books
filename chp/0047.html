But the moment's past.</p>
And whatever I do, I can't change this moment.</p>
As I'm about to call out to them they run away.</p>
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home.</p>
The real world.</p>
What are you doing here?</p>
My name is...</p>
I know who you are.  What are you doing here?</p>
I'm just trying to understand.</p>
How could you understand?</p>
Do you know what it is to be a lover?</p>
To be half of a whole?</p>
No.</p>
I'll tell you a riddle.</p>
You're waiting for a train.</p>
A train that will take you far away.
