You're trying to get that safe open?  To get the alternate will?</p>
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.  I can't let you destroy it.</p>
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.</p>
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.</p>
- What taunt?</p>
- The will, Robert. That will?</p>
That's his last insult.
