For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.
Good night.
The compound we'll be using to share the dream creates a clear connection between dreamers whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.
Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.
And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.
It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20...
Math was never my strong subject.  How much time is that?
It's a week, the first level down.
Six months the second level down, and the third level...
That's 10 years.
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
Depends on the dream.
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?
I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.
- A kick.
