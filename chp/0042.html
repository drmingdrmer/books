For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.</p>
Good night.</p>
The compound we'll be using to share the dream creates a clear connection between dreamers whilst accelerating brain function.</p>
- In other words, more time on each level.</p>
Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.</p>
And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.</p>
It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20...</p>
Math was never my strong subject.  How much time is that?</p>
It's a week, the first level down.</p>
Six months the second level down, and the third level...</p>
That's 10 years.</p>
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?</p>
Depends on the dream.</p>
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?</p>
I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.</p>
- A kick.
