<p>For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>The compound we'll be using to share the dream creates a clear connection between dreamers whilst accelerating brain function.</p>
<p>- In other words, more time on each level.</p>
<p>Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.</p>
<p>And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.</p>
<p>It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20...</p>
<p>Math was never my strong subject.  How much time is that?</p>
<p>It's a week, the first level down.</p>
<p>Six months the second level down, and the third level...</p>
<p>That's 10 years.</p>
<p>Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?</p>
<p>Depends on the dream.</p>
<p>So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?</p>
<p>I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.</p>
<p>- A kick.</p>
