I'm the head of your security down here.</p>
Get out on a different floor, keep moving.</p>
Dump the wallet.  Security will be looking for that.</p>
- Okay.</p>
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.</p>
Security, huh?</p>
- You work for the hotel?</p>
- No, no.</p>
I specialize in a very specific type of security.</p>
Subconscious security.</p>
You're talking about dreams?</p>
Are you talking about, um, extraction?</p>
I am here to protect you.</p>
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.</p>
You're not safe here.</p>
They're coming for you.
