The infinite staircase.</p>
See?</p>
Paradox.</p>
So a closed loop like that will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.</p>
But how big do these levels have to be?</p>
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.</p>

No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.</p>
