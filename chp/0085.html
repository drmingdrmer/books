I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?</p>
- Who guides Fischer in?</p>
- Not me.</p>
If I know the route, everything could be compromised.</p>
- I designed the place.</p>
- No, you're with me.</p>
I could do it.</p>
All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.</p>
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.</p>
- All right. What about you?</p>
You keep this live.  I'll be listening in the whole time.</p>

You're not coming in?</p>

Come on, Fischer!</p>
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
