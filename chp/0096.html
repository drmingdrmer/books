Choose me.</p>
You know what I have to do.</p>
I have to get back to our children because you left them.</p>
Because you left us.</p>
- You're wrong.</p>
- I'm not wrong.</p>
You're confused.</p>
Our children are here.</p>
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?</p>
Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.</p>
Up above?</p>
Listen to yourself.  These are our children.</p>
Watch.</p>
James? Phillipa?</p>
Don't do this, Mal. Please.  Those aren't my children.</p>
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.
