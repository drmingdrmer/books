Choose me.
You know what I have to do.
I have to get back to our children because you left them.
Because you left us.
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.
You're confused.
Our children are here.
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?
Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.
Up above?
Listen to yourself.  These are our children.
Watch.
James? Phillipa?
Don't do this, Mal. Please.  Those aren't my children.
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.
