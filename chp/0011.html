<p>If you can steal an idea from someone's mind why can't you plant one there instead?</p>
<p>Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.</p>
<p>I say, "Don't think about elephants." What are you thinking about?</p>
<p>Elephants.</p>
<p>Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you.</p>

<p>- True inspiration's impossible to fake.</p>
<p>- That's not true.</p>
<p>- Can you do it?</p>
<p>- Are you offering me a choice?</p>
<p>Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.</p>
<p>Then you do have a choice.</p>
<p>Then I choose to leave, sir.</p>
<p>Tell the crew where you want to go.</p>
