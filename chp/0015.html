<p>You remember.</p>
<p>It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities things that never existed things that couldn't exist in the real world.</p>
<p>So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?</p>
<p>They don't actually come into the dream.</p>
<p>They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.</p>
<p>Design it yourself.</p>
<p>Mal won't let me.</p>
<p>Come back to reality, Dom.</p>
<p>- Please.</p>
<p>- Reality.</p>
<p>Those kids, your grandchildren they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.</p>
<p>And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.</p>
<p>I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.</p>
<p>I need an architect who's as good as I was.</p>
<p>I've got somebody better.</p>
<p>Ariadne?</p>
