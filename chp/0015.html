You remember.
It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities things that never existed things that couldn't exist in the real world.
So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?
They don't actually come into the dream.
They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
Design it yourself.
Mal won't let me.
Come back to reality, Dom.
- Please.
- Reality.
Those kids, your grandchildren they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.
And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
I need an architect who's as good as I was.
I've got somebody better.
Ariadne?
