You remember.</p>
It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities things that never existed things that couldn't exist in the real world.</p>
So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?</p>
They don't actually come into the dream.</p>
They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.</p>
Design it yourself.</p>
Mal won't let me.</p>
Come back to reality, Dom.</p>
- Please.</p>
- Reality.</p>
Those kids, your grandchildren they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.</p>
And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.</p>
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.</p>
I need an architect who's as good as I was.</p>
I've got somebody better.</p>
Ariadne?
