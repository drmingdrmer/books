<p>We were lost in here.</p>
<p>I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.</p>
<p>She had locked something away, something deep inside.</p>
<p>A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.</p>
<p>And she couldn't break free.</p>
<p>So I decided to search for it.</p>
<p>I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.</p>
<p>And I broke in and I planted an idea.</p>
<p>A simple little idea that would change everything.</p>
<p>That her world wasn't real.</p>
<p>That death was the only escape.</p>
<p>You're waiting for a train.</p>
<p>A train that'll take you far away.</p>
<p>You know where you hope this train will take you but you can't know for sure.</p>
<p>Yet it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>- Now, tell me why!</p>
