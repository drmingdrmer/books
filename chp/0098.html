We were lost in here.
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.
She had locked something away, something deep inside.
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
And she couldn't break free.
So I decided to search for it.
I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
And I broke in and I planted an idea.
A simple little idea that would change everything.
That her world wasn't real.
That death was the only escape.
You're waiting for a train.
A train that'll take you far away.
You know where you hope this train will take you but you can't know for sure.
Yet it doesn't matter.
- Now, tell me why!
