We were lost in here.</p>
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.</p>
She had locked something away, something deep inside.</p>
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.</p>
And she couldn't break free.</p>
So I decided to search for it.</p>
I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.</p>
And I broke in and I planted an idea.</p>
A simple little idea that would change everything.</p>
That her world wasn't real.</p>
That death was the only escape.</p>
You're waiting for a train.</p>
A train that'll take you far away.</p>
You know where you hope this train will take you but you can't know for sure.</p>
Yet it doesn't matter.</p>
- Now, tell me why!
