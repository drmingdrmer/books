One of the longest flights in the world.  He makes it every two weeks.</p>
He must be flying private, then.</p>
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.</p>
- It would have to be a 747.</p>
- Why's that?</p>
On a 747, the pilot's up top the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.</p>
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.</p>

Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.</p>
You know how to find me.</p>
You know what you have to do.</p>

Of course I do.</p>
You said you had a dream.
