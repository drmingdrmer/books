<p>That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!</p>
<p>- She's a real charmer.</p>
<p>- Oh.</p>
<p>- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.</p>
<p>- She's his wife?</p>
<p>Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.</p>
<p>Something you can have on you that no one else knows.</p>
<p>- Like a coin?</p>
<p>- No.</p>
<p>It needs to be more unique than that.  Like, this is a loaded die.</p>
<p>No, I can't let you touch it.  That would defeat the purpose.</p>
<p>See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.</p>
<p>That way, when you look at your totem you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.</p>
<p>I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.</p>
<p>And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.</p>
<p>She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.</p>
