That we'd grow old together.</p>
And we can.</p>
You shouldn't be here.</p>
Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.</p>
- This has nothing to do with you.</p>
- This has everything to do with me.</p>
- You've asked to share dreams with you.</p>

Why do you do this to yourself?</p>
It's the only way I can still dream.</p>
Why is it so important to dream?</p>
In my dreams, we're still together.</p>
These aren't just dreams.</p>
These are memories.  And you said never to use memories.</p>
I know I did.</p>
You're trying to keep her alive.  You can't let her go.
