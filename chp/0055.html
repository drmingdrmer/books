<p>- Are you serious?</p>
<p>- Limbo?</p>
<p>- Unconstructed dream space.</p>
<p>- What the hell is down there?</p>
<p>- Just raw, infinite subconscious.</p>
<p>Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.</p>
<p>Which, in our case, is just you.</p>
<p>- How long could we be stuck?</p>
<p>- Can't even think about trying to escape until the sedation...</p>
<p>- How long?</p>
<p>Decades. It could be infinite.  Ask him, he's the one who's been there.</p>
<p>Let's get him upstairs.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.</p>
<p>And if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?</p>
