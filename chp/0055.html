- Are you serious?</p>
- Limbo?</p>
- Unconstructed dream space.</p>
- What the hell is down there?</p>
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.</p>
Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.</p>
Which, in our case, is just you.</p>
- How long could we be stuck?</p>
- Can't even think about trying to escape until the sedation...</p>
- How long?</p>
Decades. It could be infinite.  Ask him, he's the one who's been there.</p>
Let's get him upstairs.</p>
Great.</p>
Thank you.</p>
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.</p>
And if we get killed we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?
