Oh. Water, please.
Oh, um, same, please.
Um...
Thank you.
You know, I couldn't help but notice but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?
Yes, he, um...
He was my father.
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.  I'm sorry for your loss.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Hey.
To your father.
May he rest in peace, huh?
- Couldn't have peed before you went?
- Sorry.
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
