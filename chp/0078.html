I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.</p>
I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger you may not wake up.</p>
You may go into a further dream state.  Now, you know what I'm talking about.</p>
You remember the training.</p>
Remember what I said to you.</p>

- Yeah.</p>

There was, um, a lot of gunfire.</p>
There was rain.</p>
Uncle Peter.</p>
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.</p>
- Where were they holding you?</p>
- They had us in the back of a van.
