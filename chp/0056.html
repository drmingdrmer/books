<p>Someone got first aid?</p>
<p>- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?</p>
<p>- There weren't meant to be risks.</p>
<p>- Didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.</p>
<p>- You had no right.</p>
<p>This was the only way to go three layers deep.</p>
<p>You knew about this and went along with it?</p>
<p>I trusted him.</p>
<p>When? When he promised you half his share?</p>
<p>No. His whole share.  Besides, he said he'd done it before.</p>
<p>What, with Mal?  Because that worked so good?</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with it.  I did what I had to to get to my children.</p>
<p>You led us into a war zone with no way out?</p>
<p>There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as</p>
<p>possible and we get out using the kick, just like before.</p>
<p>Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes.</p>
