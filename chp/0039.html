Why is that so important?</p>
In case one of us brings in our projections.</p>
We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.</p>
You mean in case you bring Mal in.</p>
You can't keep her out, can you?</p>
- Right.</p>
- You can't build because if you know the maze, then she knows it.</p>
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.</p>
- Cobb, do the others know?</p>
- No. No, they don't.</p>
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.</p>
No one said it's getting worse.</p>
I need to get home.  That's all I care about right now.</p>
Why can't you go home?</p>
Because they think I killed her.</p>
- Thank you.
