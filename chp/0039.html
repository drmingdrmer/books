<p>Why is that so important?</p>
<p>In case one of us brings in our projections.</p>
<p>We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.</p>
<p>You mean in case you bring Mal in.</p>
<p>You can't keep her out, can you?</p>
<p>- Right.</p>
<p>- You can't build because if you know the maze, then she knows it.</p>
<p>Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.</p>
<p>- Cobb, do the others know?</p>
<p>- No. No, they don't.</p>
<p>You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.</p>
<p>No one said it's getting worse.</p>
<p>I need to get home.  That's all I care about right now.</p>
<p>Why can't you go home?</p>
<p>Because they think I killed her.</p>
<p>- Thank you.</p>
