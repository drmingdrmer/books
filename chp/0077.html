- You're not real?</p>
- No.</p>
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.</p>
I was sent here to protect you in the event that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.</p>
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.</p>
Yeah.</p>
Okay.</p>
Okay.</p>
Can you get me out of here?</p>
Right away. Follow me.</p>
Hold on a second.</p>
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?</p>
These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?</p>
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.</p>
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.</p>
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?
