<p>Something for you.</p>
<p>Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.</p>
<p>- A will.</p>
<p>- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.</p>
<p>That's an alternate.</p>
<p>This would supersede the other if you want it to.</p>
<p>It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.</p>
<p>It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.</p>
<p>Destroying my whole inheritance?</p>
<p>- Why would he suggest such a thing?</p>
<p>- I just don't know.</p>
<p>He loved you, Robert.</p>
<p>In his own way.</p>
<p>In his own way.</p>

<p>He could barely speak.</p>
