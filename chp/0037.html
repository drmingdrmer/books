Robert we need to talk about a power of attorney.</p>
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...</p>
- Not now, Uncle Peter.</p>
The vultures are circling.</p>
The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</p>
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so</p>
forth.</p>
So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning.</p>
And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.</p>
Then, when we take him a level deeper his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.</p>
So he gives himself the idea.</p>
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.  It has to seem self-generated.</p>
Eames, I am impressed.</p>
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.</p>
Were you going under on your own?</p>
No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.
