<p>Robert we need to talk about a power of attorney.</p>
<p>- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...</p>
<p>- Not now, Uncle Peter.</p>
<p>The vultures are circling.</p>
<p>The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</p>
<p>I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so</p>
<p>forth.</p>
<p>So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning.</p>
<p>And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.</p>
<p>Then, when we take him a level deeper his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.</p>
<p>So he gives himself the idea.</p>
<p>Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.  It has to seem self-generated.</p>
<p>Eames, I am impressed.</p>
<p>Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.</p>
<p>Were you going under on your own?</p>
<p>No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.</p>
